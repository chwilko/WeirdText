For each original word in the original text, leave the first and last character of it in that
position, but shuffle (permutate) all the characters in the middle of the word. If possible,
the resulting “encoded” word MUST NOT be the same as the original word. Keep
-werid-
everything else (whitespace, punctuation, etc.) like in the original. To make decoding by a
machine possible, your encoder shall also output a sorted list of original words (only
include words that got shuffled, not text that did not).
